//! Name types for commit references.

//! Name types can be constructed from a string:
//! ```
//! # use jj_lib::ref_name::*;
//! let _: RefNameBuf = "main".into();
//! let _: &RemoteName = "origin".as_ref();
//! ```
//!
//! However, they cannot be converted to other name types:

//! let _: RefNameBuf = RemoteName::new("origin").into();
//! ```
//! ```compile_fail
